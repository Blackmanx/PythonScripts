# PythonScripts

A collection of python scripts I made with different applications.

## CopyPDF

Script that asks for a pdf, then appends all its pages into the destination pdf.

Usage:

```
python copypdf.py
```

```
python copypdf.py source_pdf destination_pdf
```

## FusionPDF

Script that asks for a folder and fuses all the pdfs inside it into one.

Usage:

```
python fusionpdf.py
```

```
python fusionpdf.py --folder=/path/to/folder --output=filename.pdf
```
